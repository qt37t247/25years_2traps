# Comparing efficacy of different trapping along 27 years' effort (1998 - 2024) and looking for environmental correspondences

This repository include the key datasets and the script associated with data collection and analyses.

The study is based on a very long term monitoring of the abundance of corn earworms (_Helicoverpa zea_) using both blacklight traps and pheromone traps.



## Ecological Modelling based on very long term field survey (data and codes in folder "Ecology")

Raw data is counts of corn earworms from blacklight traps and pheromone traps between May and September.


Training data was collected from traps in Delaware over the last 27 years (1998 - 2024). The survey is ongoing and managed by the University of Delaware.

Validation data was collected from traps in New Jersey over the last 13 years (2012 - 2024).


The survey data was originally published in:
Battles, I., Burkness, E., Crossley, M. S., Edwards, C. B., Holmstrom, K., Hutchison, W., ... & Owens, A. C. (2024). Moths are less attracted to light traps than they used to be. Journal of Insect Conservation, 1-12.



## Genome-wide association study (codes in folder "Evolution")

We performed whole genome sequencing on 48 individuals colleted from both blacklight traps and pheromone traps in summer 2024 in Delaware, USA.


Raw reads of whole genome resequencing are deposited in NCBI under Bioproject PRJNA1216269


We used Genome assembly ilHelZeax1.1 (Genbank Accession: GCA_022581195.1) as the reference genome to map genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms.
