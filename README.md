# Comparing efficacy of different trapping along 27 years' effort (1998 - 2024) and looking for environmental correspondences

This repository include the key dataset and the script associated with data collection and analyses.

The insect data was from:
Battles, I., Burkness, E., Crossley, M. S., Edwards, C. B., Holmstrom, K., Hutchison, W., ... & Owens, A. C. (2024). Moths are less attracted to light traps than they used to be. Journal of Insect Conservation, 1-12.

The analyses of this work is inspired by:
MÃ¼ller, J., Hothorn, T., Yuan, Y., Seibold, S., Mitesser, O., Rothacher, J., ... & Menzel, A. (2023). Weather explains the decline and rise of insect biomass over 34 years. Nature, 1-6.

## Step 1. Environmental data collection
We collected air quality data from Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center:

https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/

We used the R code ("crop.R" and "extract.R") to extract environmental variables at the sampling points.

We collected other environmental variables from Google Earth Engine (with the python package geemap https://geemap.org/). See python script ("GEE_collect.ipynb").

The environemental variables are then compiled for the subseqeuent modeling with R ("Data_process.R")


## Step 2. Generalized additive mixed modelling (GAM)

We combined insect count data with the environmental variables ("Data_build.R").

This resulting the file ("master.csv") for the subsequent GAM.

We deviced six-stepped modelling ("Model_GAM.R") with each step adding additional complexity in the models. 


## Step 3. Confirming mechanism of findings with genome wide association studies (GWAS).

Well, the result of the ecological modelling is a bit obsurd to interpret. Let's try to find something in the genomes. 

All the codes associated with the genomic analyses have been deposit in sub-folder ("genomics").
